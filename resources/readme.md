# CASE FILE:	Pulverized Power

March 20, 2020

A local power company has been experiencing multiple cases of equipment malfunction and suspects sabotage.

## Background

Charles Puckett, regional manager at Tri-City Power has requested that I look into a string of broken substation circuit breakers. My instinct tells me something fishy is going on here and these outages aren't a mere coincidence. I need to interview the local employees and gather evidence if I'm to confirm this hunch. 

All evidence I collect will be stored with on this disk.
